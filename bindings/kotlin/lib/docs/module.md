# Module ouisync

## Quick start

Include ouisync with Gradle by adding the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```
implementation "ie.equalit.ouinet:ouisync-omni:$ouisyncVersion"
```

The entry point to Ouisync is the [Session](org.equalitie.ouisync.lib.Session) class. [Create]
(org.equalitie.ouisync.lib.Session.Companion.create) it near the start of the app and make effort
to [close](org.equalitie.ouisync.lib.Session.close) it on app shutdown. Afterwards, use the
[Repository](org.equalitie.ouisync.lib.Repository) class to create and manage your Ouisync
repositories and use the [File](org.equalitie.ouisync.lib.File) class to access the repository
content.
